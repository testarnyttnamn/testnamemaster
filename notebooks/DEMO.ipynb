    "# DEMO: CLOE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**: this DEMO allows to compute the Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing observational probes as defined in the current recipe and computes the likelihood value given some benchmark data. It uses `Cobaya` as the main Bayesian Analysis tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains three potential different scenarios for the user (called user-cases) corresponding to CASE 1, 2 and 3 in the notebook. A basic description of each of the user-case is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CASE 1**: samples the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest (cosmological or nuisance parameters) by running `Cobaya` with the external Euclid Likelihood and the sampler of your choice within the list of samplers available in `Cobaya`. At the moment, this user case executes a single point evaluation of the likelihood using the `Cobaya` sampler `evaluate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CASE 2**: creates a `model` of `Cobaya` using an internal wrapper of `Cobaya` itself. This wrapper is based on the sampler `evaluate` of `Cobaya`. The `model` allows you to make a single computation of the priors, likelihoods and posterior, measure the time needed by each module or retrieve the information of which theoretical quantities were asked to the Boltzman solvers, for instance. This `model` instance is important, because it is the way the connection between `Cobaya` and the `EuclidLikelihood` code is made internally within `cobaya_interface.py`. In fact, the `model` instance is essential if you want to run CASE 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CASE 2.1**: the final section of the notebook retrieves and plots internal theoretical quantities computed by the CLOE code. Be aware that, to be able to retrieve and plot quantities, you need to run first **CASE 2**, because CASE 2.1 requires the `model` instance to be loaded. You can plot the following quantities:\n",
    "    * $H(z)$: Hubble factor\n",
    "    * $r(z)$, $D_A$: comoving and angular diameter distances\n",
    "    * $\\sigma_8$, $f\\sigma_8$: amplitude of the (linear) power spectrum on the scale of 8 $h^{-1} Mpc$, and the product of the growth rate, and the amplitude of the (linear) power spectrum on the scale of 8 $h^{-1} Mpc$\n",
    "    * $D(z)$, $f(z)$: growth factor and growth rate\n",
    "    * $P_m, P_{gg}, P_{g\\delta}, P_{\\delta i}, P_{gi}, P_{ii}$: matter power spectrum obtained by the Boltzman solver by `Cobaya` and different power spectra\n",
    "    * $n(z)$: galaxy density distributions\n",
    "    * $W_i^{GC}, W_i^{\\gamma}, W_i^{IA}$: window functions or kernel for Galaxy Clustering (GC), Shear ($\\gamma$) and Intrinsic Alignment.\n",
    "    * $C_\\ell$: angular power spectra\n",
    "    * $P_\\ell$: Legendre multiples\n",
