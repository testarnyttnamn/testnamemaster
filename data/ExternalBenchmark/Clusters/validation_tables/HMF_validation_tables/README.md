Truth tables for the halo mass function.
Full equations for the computation of the HMF can be find here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/ngkgbsbfwcry

The 6 files truth-table-* contain the relevant values for the validation of the HMF.
Columns are: 
1. Mass in terms of virial masses in units of [M$`_\odot`$]
2. $`\nu(M,z)`$
3. $`dn/dM=\nu f(\nu)`$
4. $` d\ln(\sigma(M,z))/d \ln R `$


The redshifts are specified in the file name, and they are:

- $` z_0 = 0.0 `$
- $` z_1=0.2137 `$
- $` z_2=0.4252 `$
- $` z_3=0.6734 `$
- $` z_4=0.9649 `$
- $` z_5=1.7091 `$

The cosmological parameters are defined in the file "cosmological_params.txt"
