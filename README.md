# Mock structure for COBAYA as external likelihood

### What's COBAYA?

Cobaya (code for bayesian analysis, and Spanish for Guinea Pig) is a framework for sampling and statistical modelling: it allows you to explore an arbitrary prior or posterior using a range of Monte Carlo samplers (including the advanced MCMC sampler from CosmoMC, and the advanced nested sampler PolyChord).

### COBAYA's documentation

Check [documentation](https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Install COBAYA

Install Cobaya by simply running:

```bash
pip install cobaya --upgrade
```

### Calling external likelihood


### Run unit test
To run the unit tests locally run:

```bash
python setup.py test
```

Note that this requires the development tools.
