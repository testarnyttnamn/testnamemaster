About this code
==================

The software "Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid" (CLOE) is a Euclid product which allows to read Euclid data, calculate the Likelihood and estimate cosmological parameters for different probes and observables.
The software development is coordinated by the Euclid Inter-Science Task Force for Likelihood (IST:Likelihood, IST:L); the development of recipes that apply at non-linear scales is coordinated by the Inter-Science Task Force for Non-Linearities (IST:Non-Linear, IST:NL). 
These two task forces have been created by the Euclid Science Working Groups for Weak Gravitational Lensing, Galaxy Clustering, and Theory. 
All content, and in particular the description of the observables, is developed thanks to Euclid science working groups; data are provided by Euclid OU-LE3.
